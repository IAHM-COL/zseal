zseal
open source client for FICS Timeseal v2 for Linux/Unix systems

Timeseal is a protocol for network lag reporting and compensation used by the FICS chess
server (freechess.org). Version 2 of the protocol provides better delay stats as the server
actively pings the client periodically. FICS's FTP repository was taken down a few years
ago in one of the server host changes or hard disk crashes (I forget which) and was never
put back on. Since then, there has been nowhere to download a trustable timeseal client
for Linux systems.

The protocol was deduced from Marcello Mamino's openseal (an implementation of timeseal v1)
and the java timeseal v2 implementation in Raptor by cday - https://github.com/Raptor-Fics-Interface/Raptor
